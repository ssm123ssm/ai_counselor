How many questions to answer?
Research reveal that answering more questions, regardless of certainty, led to higher overall marks.
Answer &quot;don&#39;t know&quot; only for questions where one is totally uncertain.

Positive impact of reviewing and re-answering questions
Better performers tend to be more cautious and reflective.
Tag questions for review while you go through the paper and re-answer them later.

Re-answering behavior:
Benefits of reviewing and re-answering questions, aligning with existing research.
The studies recommends encouraging students, after further reflection, to change their answers in MCQ
tests, for questions where they had initial doubts. The findings challenge the belief that the first answer
that comes to mind is always the best and emphasize the importance of reconsideration in achieving
better results in high-stakes medical examinations. Changing answers, particularly from incorrect to
correct, positively impacts test scores. The results emphasize the need to educate medical students
about the value of reconsidering initial answers and challenging the misconception that the first
response is always optimal.

Efficient time management
Students tend to spent significantly more time on incorrectly answered questions.
Review your paper and understand why you spent longer time on certain questions. Is it the question
difficulty or the language proficiency? Understanding the reasons for time variations aid in better
remedial measures.

Some strategies to answer MCQs
  Do chapter by chapter, studying - topic-based manner
  Before studying go through the MCQs- Can get an idea about what to study
  Categorize past questions according to topics
  Practice MCQ papers as a whole at the end, near the exam- will sum up all that have learned

Strategies to answer essays in the exam
 Before the exams, answer past essay questions- Practice by answering more questions
  Review answered questions by a staff member to ensure accuracy
  Allocate time for Short Answer Question (SAQ) discussions
  Receive individual feedback on your particular answers
  Timing for studying and answering
  Categorize past questions according to topics
  Stop studying in detail- Do question based studying
