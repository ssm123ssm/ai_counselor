It's great to have the opportunity to chat with you today. I see from your self-evaluation that you've got a structured approach to your studies by making a plan, which is fantastic. It's also interesting to note that you enjoy playing carrom as a way to cope with stress, and you've identified that managing sleepiness during study times is a challenge for you. Let's tackle these points one at a time.\n\nFirstly, regarding your study technique of studying a lesson and then doing past SAQ questions, it sounds like a solid strategy. It helps reinforce the material you've just learned. However, you mentioned wanting to improve how you write SAQ answers. One approach could be to review your answers with a peer or a tutor who can provide feedback. Have you tried discussing your answers with someone else for a different perspective?\n\nAlso, about the sleepiness you experience during study times, it might be helpful to look into your sleep schedule and study environment. Are you getting enough rest at night? Is your study area conducive to staying alert and focused?","createdAt":"2024-02-16T07:11:23.743Z"}]
