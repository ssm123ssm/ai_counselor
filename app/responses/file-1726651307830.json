However, it seems like you might benefit from additional strategies to reinforce your understanding.\n\nHave you ever tried using other study techniques, such as making mind maps, using flashcards, or practicing active recall? These methods can sometimes make it easier to grasp and remember difficult concepts.",

This involves testing yourself on the material you've just read, rather than just re-reading it. For example, after reading a section of your lecture notes, close the notes and try to write down or explain the key points from memory.\n\nWould you be willing to give this a try? It can be a very effective way to improve your understanding and retention of the material.",

Another technique you might find helpful is **making short notes** or summaries of what you've learned. This can help reinforce the material and make it easier to review later.\n\nYou mentioned that sometimes you talk to family members to cope with stress. That's a great strategy. How do you feel after these conversations? Do they help you feel more relaxed and focused?",
