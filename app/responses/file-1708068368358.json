It's great to have the opportunity to chat with you today. I've had a chance to look over your self-evaluation data sheet, and I want to start by acknowledging the effort you've put into understanding your own study habits and stress levels. It's a crucial step towards making positive changes. Let's tackle these one at a time, starting with your study techniques and stress management.\n\nI see that you primarily use lecture notes for studying and that you're experiencing high levels of stress. It's also interesting to note that you find doing past papers helpful, which is a great strategy. However, you've identified that writing Short Answer Questions (SAQs) and concentrating in the lecture hall are areas where you face challenges. \n\nFirstly, regarding your stress levels, you mentioned that going home is your common coping strategy. While it's important to have a safe and comforting space to retreat to, we might explore additional strategies to manage stress, especially when going home isn't an option. How do you feel about incorporating techniques such as meditation, short music breaks, or even brief walks to help manage stress during your study sessions or lecture times?\n\nNow, about improving your SAQ answers, it's a skill that can definitely be developed with practice and guidance. Have you had the opportunity to receive feedback on your SAQs from your professors or peers? This could provide valuable insights into where you can improve.\n\nLet's also talk about your concentration in lecture halls. It can be challenging, especially if the environment doesn't suit your learning style. Have you tried sitting in different areas of the lecture hall to see if it makes a difference in your ability to concentrate? Additionally, taking active notes rather than just reading from the lecture slides might help keep your mind engaged.\n\nI'm here to help guide you through these improvements. Let's start by addressing one area you'd like to focus on first. What feels most pressing to you right now?","createdAt":"2024-02-16T07:23:13.129Z"}]
