    "content": "That's a great question, Piyashakthi. Effective recall is crucial for doing well in exams, especially in a demanding field like medicine. Here are a few strategies that might help you improve your recall:\n\n1. **Active Recall**: This involves testing yourself on the material you’ve studied rather than just re-reading your notes. For example, after studying a topic, close your notes and try to write down everything you remember. Then, check your notes to see what you missed.\n\n2. **Spaced Repetition**: This technique involves reviewing the material at increasing intervals over time. There are apps like Anki that can help you with this by scheduling reviews based on how well you know each piece of information.\n\n3. **Mnemonics and Flashcards**: Creating mnemonics or using flashcards can help you remember complex information. Flashcards are particularly useful for memorizing drug classifications and names.\n\n4. **Mind Maps and Diagrams**: Visual aids like mind maps can help you organize information in a way that makes it easier to recall. Drawing diagrams can also help, especially for understanding processes and systems.\n\n5. **Teach What You Learn**: Explaining the material to someone else, or even to yourself, can reinforce your understanding and recall. This is often referred to as the Feynman Technique.\n\n6. **Regular Review Sessions**: Instead of cramming, try to review your notes regularly. This could be daily or weekly, depending on your schedule.\n\nYou mentioned that you start studying properly mainly in the last few weeks. Incorporating some of these techniques into your daily routine might help you spread out your study sessions and improve your recall over time.\n\nHow do you feel about trying some of these methods? Is there one that stands out to you as something you’d like to start with?",
