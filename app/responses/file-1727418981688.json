Note down the activities you engage in and how long you spend on each. This will give us a clearer picture of where your time is going.\n\nOnce you have this log, we can review it together and identify areas for improvement. In the meantime, consider setting small, achievable study goals for each session. For example, you might aim to review a specific lecture note or complete a set of SAQ papers within a certain timeframe.\n\nHow does that sound to you?",

Keeping a time log and setting small, achievable goals can really help in making your study sessions more focused and productive.\n\nLet's also touch on your stress levels. You mentioned that your stress level is moderate and that you cope by sleeping and watching movies. These are good ways to relax, but it's also important to have a variety of coping strategies.\n\nHave you tried any other methods, like meditation, exercise, or talking to friends or family about your stress? Sometimes, incorporating a few different strategies can make a big difference in how you manage stress.",
