How do you usually balance your time between these different resources? Do you have a specific strategy for when to use each one?",

    "content": "That sounds like a practical approach. Using SAQs and lecture notes as your primary resources and referring to textbooks for deeper understanding is a good strategy. However, you mentioned that one of the weaknesses of your study technique is a lack of practice with writing. \n\nWriting practice is crucial, especially for essay and short answer questions. Have you considered integrating more writing exercises into your study routine? For example, you could try summarizing what you've learned in your own words or practicing writing out answers to potential exam questions. How do you feel about that?",

    "content": "It's understandable that writing can feel time-consuming, especially if you're not used to it. However, improving your writing speed and clarity can be very beneficial, especially for exams that require written responses.\n\nOne way to gradually improve your writing skills is to start with short, timed writing sessions. For example, you could set a timer for 10-15 minutes and write as much as you can on a specific topic or question. Over time, you can increase the duration and complexity of these sessions.\n\nAdditionally, you might find it helpful to review and get feedback on your written work. This can help you identify areas for improvement and build confidence. Have you tried discussing your written answers with peers or mentors? How do you feel about incorporating this into your routine?",

It might be helpful to make these discussions a more regular part of your routine.\n\nYou could set up a study group with a few friends where you all write answers to the same questions and then review each other's work. This way, you can benefit from collective feedback and also help each other stay motivated.\n\nAdditionally, you mentioned that you use movies and sleep as coping strategies for stress. These are good ways to relax, but have you considered incorporating other stress management techniques, such as meditation or recreational activities? These can also help improve your overall well-being and focus. How do you feel about trying some new stress management strategies?",
