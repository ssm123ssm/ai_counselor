It's important to find a balance that allows you to rest and recharge while still keeping up with your studies.\n\nOne approach you might consider is breaking your study sessions into shorter, more manageable chunks. For example, studying for 30 minutes to an hour with short breaks in between can help maintain your focus and reduce fatigue. \n\nHave you tried any techniques like this, or do you think it might be something that could work for you?",

Here are a few simple steps to get you started with a basic meditation practice:\n\n1. **Find a Quiet Space**: Choose a quiet, comfortable place where you won't be disturbed.\n2. **Sit Comfortably**: Sit in a comfortable position, either on a chair or on the floor with your back straight.\n3. **Close Your Eyes**: Gently close your eyes to help minimize distractions.\n4. **Focus on Your Breath**: Pay attention to your breathing. Notice the sensation of the air entering and leaving your nostrils, or the rise and fall of your chest.\n5. **Stay Present**: If your mind starts to wander, gently bring your focus back to your breath. It's normal for thoughts to come and go; the key is to keep returning your attention to your breathing.\n6. **Start Small**: Begin with just a few minutes each day and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable with the practice.\n\nWould you like more detailed guidance on any specific type of meditation, or do you have any questions about starting this practice?",
