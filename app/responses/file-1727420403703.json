    "content": "I understand, Thiwanka. It sounds like you're finding it challenging to maintain focus for extended periods. This is quite common, and there are several strategies we can explore to help with this. \n\nOne approach is to break your study sessions into shorter, more manageable chunks. For example, you could try studying for 25-30 minutes and then taking a 5-minute break. This technique is known as the Pomodoro Technique and can help maintain your focus and reduce sleepiness.\n\nHave you tried any specific strategies to manage your study time and breaks?",

    "content": "It's good that you're experimenting with different methods to stay awake and engaged. Studying while walking and reading aloud can indeed help to some extent. However, it might not be sustainable for long periods.\n\nLet's try to incorporate some structured techniques. The Pomodoro Technique I mentioned earlier could be a good start. Here's how you can implement it:\n\n1. **Set a Timer:** Study for 25 minutes without any distractions.\n2. **Take a Break:** After 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break. Use this time to stretch, walk around, or do something relaxing.\n3. **Repeat:** After four 25-minute sessions, take a longer break of 15-30 minutes.\n\nThis method can help keep your mind fresh and reduce the likelihood of feeling sleepy. \n\nWould you be willing to give this a try and see if it helps?",

Remember, it's all about finding what works best for you and being consistent with it.\n\nNow, let's talk a bit about your stress levels. You mentioned that your stress level is moderate and that you cope by sleeping and watching movies. These are good ways to relax, but it's also important to have a variety of coping strategies.\n\nHave you tried any other methods, such as meditation, exercise, or talking to friends or family about your stress?",
