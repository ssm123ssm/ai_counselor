This can help you quickly review the most important points without having to go through the entire textbook again. \n\nAdditionally, categorizing past questions according to topics can help you focus your study sessions more effectively. Have you ever tried using techniques like mnemonics or flashcards to help with memorization?",

Since you've used them before, you might consider incorporating them more regularly into your study routine.\n\nAnother strategy could be to set aside specific times for different subjects each day. This can help ensure that you're covering all necessary material without feeling overwhelmed. \n\nHow do you currently manage your study schedule? Do you have a set routine, or do you study more flexibly based on what you feel needs attention?",

For example, you might dedicate mornings to pharmacology and afternoons to pathology, with some time set aside for reviewing past questions or creating summary notes.\n\nWould you be open to trying a more structured study schedule?
